# Machine Learning Miniproject 2: IMDB movie review sentiment classification

## Introduction
The dataset under consideration contains a total of 50,000 movie reviews
obtained from the Internet Movie Database. These reviews have been divided into two
distinct sets: a training set comprising 25,000 reviews and a testing set consisting of the
remaining 25,000 reviews. It is noteworthy that the reviews are not uniformly distributed
across the entire spectrum of sentiment; rather, they are dichotomous in nature, with
half of the reviews expressing positive sentiments and the other half expressing
negative sentiments.

## Objectives
1) In this exercise, you will construct three distinct machine learning models
for sentiment classification using the provided dataset. As a machine learning expert,
your objective is to identify suitable methods and evaluate their performance to achieve
optimal results. You are permitted to utilize any model introduced during the course, in
addition to approaches not covered that you deem applicable to your research. These
may include traditional methods and deep neural networks (DNNs) with fine-tuning.
Examples of such methods include CNNs, RNNs, Transformers architectures, Random
Forests, Naïve Bayes, and SVM.

2) Compare and visualize the learning curves and performance of the three
models.

3) Write a scientific report which includes
• Introduction (what is the problem you are solving?)
• Data processing (what are the choices you made in data processing and how
you performed it?)
• Modelling (What are the modeling approaches? How have you performed
them? Why do you think one model performed better than the other one? What
can be done better? Can achieve over 80% accuracy?)
• Conclusions (what were the “scientific” bottlenecks? How did you overcome
them? What is the result you obtained with your best model? Etc..)

## Data processing

We were tasked to use Hugging face dataset tool. However I encountered some problems trying to download the library. Therefore I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.
